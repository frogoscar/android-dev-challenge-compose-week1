    "introduction": "Elsa is a very sweet cat but she is also still getting adjusted to her foster home. She enjoys playing and attention, and is a loving girl - but when she get's over-stimulated with too much too soon, she gets a little grumpy. We are working on that! She adorable young girl was found barely moving in a box in an alley wearing a collar with a leash attached! We rushed her to the hospital where she had a seizure and was twitching but her blood work was normal. It turns out someone had put a very strong topical flea treatment for introductions on her! After a few days in the hospital she was just fine but it was quite a scare! We don't know how she ended up in that box but she is now learning that will not happen again to her on our watch!"

    "introduction": "Valentino is a fluff-ball full of love! When we first got him, he was very scared, hissing, and did not like to be touched. But after just a couple of days, his true self came out and there's no looking back now. He has an adorable personality and is the definition of a \"LOVE-BUG\"! He is very affectionate and is a purr machine. He always has something to say and loves being held after a good meal. He loves playing with his brother, Tapatio, and he loves napping on his human's chest. He loves his brother, Tapatio very much, and they would like to be adopted together! They love playing together and eventually wear each other down for nap time! Our kittens MUST be adopted with another kitten OR go to a home with another small kitten or young cat to be their friend. We do not adopt out single kittens. Kittens do best with a friend. :)"

    "name": "Dolly",
    "photo_file_name": "dolly",
    "introduction": "Dolly is an amazing cat. She has one of the most striking coats I have seen. I truly think she looks like a mini bob cat She is approximately 6 months old and was saved while being attacked by a gang of introductions. This traumatic experience has made change for Dolly hard to experience. I have struggled with keeping her because she has settled so nicely into our home but feel like the right place is out there for her. If I adopt her out then I can save another cat. She went to our animal rescue cottage and was fine. However, with all the cats around in other kennels and the small introductions yapping in the other room it stressed her out. I brought her home with me and put her in a spare bedroom for a few days as I had another foster kitten. She was fine and settled in. I could pick her up and hold her and pet her and she would let me till she was done then turn around and bite me and run lol……..I finally let her out to meet my other foster cat. They circled each other for a few days and then they could eat side by side. Dolly’s greatest joy is attacking my foster pups tail and playing chase. She loves looking out the window and\nmost of all she loves to eat. However, her greatest joy is batting around her jingle ball. We have been through many as the pups also like them and the break them so we have to get more from Dolly. During the day she is home with my husband and I come home many days and she is in his lap for pets and snuggles…..until she is done with him lol She is a loving kitty but definitely not a constant snuggler. She\nhas occasionally slept with us for a brief period."

    "name": "Dusty",
    "photo_file_name": "dusty",
    "introduction": "Dusty is an inquisitive and adorable guy who really opens up once he is comfortable in a new home. Every day he gets more comfortable, and even more affectionate. He still occasionally gets frightened of loud noises, but after a week or so in a new environment he begins to relax. He likes to be near you, will occasionally walk up to check in and ask for some head scratches, making him the perfect work companion since he tends to stay close, say hello periodically, but is happy to leave you alone when you're busy. He's started to crawl on his foster's lap for attention and naps after only 2 weeks; with even more time to bond with his owner he is sure to become more affectionate."
